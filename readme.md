API developed during Java Inter Bootcamp.

## Introduction

This project was developed as a part of a series of courses within Java Inter Bootcamp, offered by Digital Innovation
One. The idea is to create a reactive API using Spring Boot framework.

## Tools and Technologies Used

The main tools used in this course is:

- **Spring Boot**: Spring project that makes significantly easier to start Spring projects by simply adding starters inside pom.xml.
- **Spring WebFlux**: framework designed to build reactive spring applications by processing non-blocking and asynchronous
  requests.
  
- **Junit**: library used for unit tests in Java.
- **Intellij Community Edition**: Jetbrains IDE focused on languages that run in JVM.
- **Postman**: Development app that tests API endpoints.
- **Swagger**: helps to create documentation for APIs.
