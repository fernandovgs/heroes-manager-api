API developed during Java Inter Bootcamp.

## Introduction

This project was developed as a part of a series of courses within Java Inter Bootcamp, offered by Digital Innovation
One. The idea is to create a reactive API using Spring Boot framework.

The API manages information related with fictional superheroes, by using a non-relational database: DynamoDB.

## Tools and Technologies Used

The main tools used in this course is:

- **Spring Boot**: Spring project that makes significantly easier to start Spring projects by simply adding starters inside pom.xml.
- **Spring WebFlux**: framework designed to build reactive spring applications by processing non-blocking and asynchronous
  requests.
  
- **Junit**: library used for unit tests in Java.
- **Intellij Community Edition**: Jetbrains IDE focused on languages that run in JVM.
- **Postman**: Development app that tests API endpoints.
- **Swagger**: helps to create documentation for APIs.
- **DynamoDB**: non-relational database developed by Amazon.

## About Development Process

The development process was pretty straightforward, following teacher's instructions to build the API. However, I tried to put all dependencies as updated as possible, which led me to some difficulties, like configuring DynamoDB on Spring almost by myself. I also used JUnit 5 instead of JUnit 4, using previous knowledge from another course within Java Inter Bootcamp.

Another difficulty was configuring AWS environment on my desktop. I didn't know a lot about AWS services, so creating an account, getting the credentials and putting on my PC (currently using Manjaro) was something a little bit harsh, but it was fun, also!
